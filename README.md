# TV Series Recommender
The TV series recommender system is a machine learning-based solution designed to enhance the anime-watching experience by providing personalized and general recommendations. It leverages user interaction and popularity metrics to suggest anime titles. The system operates in two modes:

* Personalized Recommendations: Recommends anime titles based on the user’s previously watched anime. It employs collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid techniques to identify and suggest similar or related anime.
* Popularity-Based Recommendations: Suggests trending and widely popular anime from the dataset, catering to users seeking recommendations without prior preferences.

This recommender system not only helps users explore new anime titles efficiently but also boosts user engagement by providing tailored recommendations aligned with their interests.

## Problem statement
The increasing volume of anime content available on various streaming platforms presents users with the challenge of selecting suitable titles to watch. This can lead to decision fatigue and decreased user satisfaction, especially for individuals unfamiliar with specific genres or trends in anime.

A robust recommender system is needed to address this challenge by:

1. Providing personalized anime suggestions based on a user’s watch history and preferences.
2. Offering popularity-based recommendations to introduce users to trending or critically acclaimed anime.

The solution should ensure user satisfaction by reducing decision-making time and enhancing the discovery of anime titles aligned with user preferences or current trends.
